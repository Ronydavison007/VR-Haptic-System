# VR-Haptic-System
The Virtual Reality (VR) Haptic System is designed to provide a tactile feedback to enhance the immersive experiences in virtual environments. This system integrates with VR softwares like Unity to perform tasks in
a 3-D virtual environment. Unlike haptic gloves and trackers, the system utilizes computer vision to track hands and perform all other operations in a virtual environment.
